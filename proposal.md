Choose Your Own Adventure Project Proposal and Learning Goals


We will be working on the San Francisco Crime Classification dataset.

Group members: Nur Shlapbobersky and Bill Wong

#### Learning Goals:

Bill: I want to learn how computing certainty probabilities in machine learning algorithms work.  For the titanic project, we computed whether or not we thought a particular person survived, but not how confident our model was with its decision.  Our model this project should output probabilities instead of best-guesses.

Nur: I want to use maps to validate and enable our data explorations and other modeling decisions. Iâ€™d also like to learn how to apply Bayesian probabilities in a machine learning context, e.g. how do crimes on a given day affect the probability that other crimes will be committed?

#### How this project will fulfill these goals:

The kaggle competition requires that people submit their results in terms of probabilities, so our model will have to use that.  We can use visual maps in our ipython notebooks using matplotlib, and we can look at previous scripts that use Bayesian probabilities and incorporate them into our model.
